Currently in "Every" "Ringer mode" when I set a reminder to start at 2:00pm to repeat every 1 min and end after 3 occurrences, it will triggers at 2:00pm then I press snooze 5m, then continues triggers 2:01pm and 2:02 pm. In the reminder card in the active reminder page it says ended even though snoozed reminder is pending to trigger at 2:05pm, also when I press done for 2:05pm it is not entered in the completed page reminder card counter, and done time is not registered and not marking as complete by turning counter button with green ring. Also I get a notification that I missed a ringer reminder at 2:00pm, which is not accurate I press snoozed to that.



WHAT I NEED.
Reminder triggers at 2:00pm
>Pressed Snooze 5min
>Don't trigger at 2:01pm and 2:02pm.

>In the reminder card in the active reminders page show Snoozed until 2:05pm with snoozed badge (ref: already existing).

>Trigger at 2:05pm.

>Update in completed page reminder card for count and time.

>Occurrence 1 completed.
>Occurrence 2 at 2:06, Occurrence 3 at 2:07.
>Reminder completed.
>Remove the card from Active reminders page as user press done for last occurrence.
>Green ring for counter button in the completed page corresponding reminder card. Time too.



*If "End time" instead of "Occurrence".

If editing requires in android, edit in plugins otherwise it will loose on prebuild.

Fix it efficiently without errors.
Native code should be in sync with JS code. App open state and App closed state should behave the same.NO duplicate reminders, time slip, race conditions etc. (Analyse current state and act accordingly)
Prebuild and VERIFY that it will meet my conditions.
