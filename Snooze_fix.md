Snooze function is not working properly in "Ringer mode" reminder.(Fullscreen intent alarms)
WHAT I NEED.
Eg: I set a reminder in "Every" with start time 2:00pm to repeat every 1 min and end after 3 occurrences.

Reminder triggers at 2:00pm
>Pressed Snooze 5min
>Don't trigger at 2:01pm and 2:02pm.

>In the reminder card in the active reminders page show Snoozed until 2:05pm with snoozed badge (ref: already existing).

>Trigger at 2:05pm.

>Update in completed page reminder card for count and time.

>Occurrence 1 completed.
>Occurrence 2 at 2:06, Occurrence 3 at 2:07.
>Reminder completed.
>Remove the card from Active reminders page as user press done for last occurrence.
>Green ring for counter button in the completed page corresponding reminder card. Time too.



*If "End time" instead of "Occurrence".

If editing requires in android, edit in plugins otherwise it will loose on prebuild.

Fix it efficiently without errors.
Prebuild and verify.
