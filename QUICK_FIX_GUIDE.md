# Quick Fix Guide

## ✅ What's Already Fixed

### TypeScript Bundling Error
- **File**: `hooks/notification-service.ts`
- **Issue**: Missing closing brace causing "export may only appear at top level"
- **Status**: **FIXED** ✅
- **Result**: App should now bundle successfully

## 🔧 What You Need to Fix Manually

### Three Kotlin Files Need Updates

The Kotlin files cannot be edited automatically. You need to manually update them.

### Quick Steps:

1. **Open the comprehensive prompt file**:
   ```
   GEMINI_KOTLIN_FIX_COMPREHENSIVE_PROMPT.md
   ```

2. **Copy the code for each file and replace**:

   **File 1**: `android/app/src/main/java/app/rork/dominder_android_reminder_app/alarm/AlarmActivity.kt`
   - Find the section "AlarmActivity.kt (COMPLETE REPLACEMENT)"
   - Copy the entire code block
   - Replace the file content

   **File 2**: `android/app/src/main/java/app/rork/dominder_android_reminder_app/alarm/AlarmReceiver.kt`
   - Find the section "AlarmReceiver.kt (COMPLETE REPLACEMENT)"
   - Copy the entire code block
   - Replace the file content

   **File 3**: `android/app/src/main/java/app/rork/dominder_android_reminder_app/MainActivity.kt`
   - Find the section "MainActivity.kt (COMPLETE REPLACEMENT)"
   - Copy the entire code block
   - Replace the file content

3. **Rebuild the app**:
   ```bash
   cd android
   ./gradlew clean
   cd ..
   npm run android
   ```

## 🎯 What These Fixes Do

### Before Fixes:
- ❌ Snooze/Done buttons don't work
- ❌ Alarm always shows full-screen (even when unlocked)
- ❌ No communication to React Native
- ❌ Actions don't trigger reminder updates

### After Fixes:
- ✅ Snooze button reschedules reminder for 10 minutes
- ✅ Done button marks reminder as complete
- ✅ Locked screen → Full-screen alarm
- ✅ Unlocked screen → Persistent notification
- ✅ Notification tap opens alarm screen
- ✅ Actions properly update reminders
- ✅ App closes after action

## 📋 Testing Checklist

After applying Kotlin fixes:

- [ ] Lock phone → Set ringer reminder → Full-screen alarm appears
- [ ] Unlock phone → Set ringer reminder → Notification appears
- [ ] Tap notification → Opens alarm screen
- [ ] Tap Snooze → Reminder rescheduled
- [ ] Tap Done → Reminder marked complete
- [ ] Check logs for "alarmAction event"

## 🐛 If Issues Persist

Check logs:
```bash
adb logcat | grep -E "AlarmActivity|AlarmReceiver|MainActivity|RootLayout"
```

Look for:
- "Alarm received!"
- "Screen state - isScreenOn: X, isLocked: Y"
- "Handling alarm action: X for reminderId: Y"
- "Sent alarmAction event to React Native"
- "Received alarmAction event"
