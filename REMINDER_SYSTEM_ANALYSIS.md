2025-10-12

## Executive Summary
Performed comprehensive deep-dive analysis of the reminder system implementation including background handling, notification hooks, reminder engine, scheduling, and Android system integration. Identified and fixed 7 critical issues affecting reliability and user experience.

---

## Critical Issues Found & Fixed

### 1. ✅ FIXED: Snooze Flow for "Once" Reminders
**Issue**: When a "once" (non-repeating) reminder was snoozed and later the user pressed "Done", the system would mark it as completed without properly handling the snoozed state.

**Root Cause**: 
- `markReminderDone()` checked `repeatType === 'none'` and immediately marked as completed
- Did not check if reminder was in snoozed state first
- Snoozed "once" reminders should complete when Done is pressed, not reschedule

**Fix Applied** (`services/reminder-scheduler.ts`):
```typescript
// Added explicit check for snoozed "once" reminders
if (reminder.snoozeUntil && reminder.repeatType === 'none') {
  console.log(`[Scheduler] Snoozed 'once' reminder ${reminderId} marked as done - completing it`);
  reminder.isCompleted = true;
  reminder.snoozeUntil = undefined;
  reminder.wasSnoozed = undefined;
  reminder.lastTriggeredAt = new Date().toISOString();
  await updateReminder(reminder);
}
```

**Impact**: Snoozed "once" reminders now correctly complete when user presses Done.

---

### 2. ✅ FIXED: Snooze State Cleanup
**Issue**: After snoozing, the `snoozeUntil` and `wasSnoozed` fields were not being cleared properly in all code paths, causing incorrect next fire time calculations.

**Root Cause**:
- Multiple code paths didn't clear snooze state
- `markReminderDone()` for repeating reminders cleared snooze, but "once" reminders didn't
- Missing `lastTriggeredAt` timestamp updates

**Fix Applied** (`services/reminder-scheduler.ts`):
```typescript
// In rescheduleReminderById - added lastTriggeredAt
reminder.lastTriggeredAt = new Date().toISOString();

// In markReminderDone - clear snooze state in all paths
reminder.snoozeUntil = undefined;
reminder.wasSnoozed = undefined;
reminder.lastTriggeredAt = new Date().toISOString();
```

**Impact**: Snooze state is now properly cleared, preventing stale snooze times from affecting scheduling.

---

### 3. ✅ FIXED: Redundant Notification Scheduling
**Issue**: The reminder engine was rescheduling notifications on every reminder change, even if the notification was already scheduled with the same parameters.

**Root Cause**:
- `reminder-engine.tsx` used a simple Set with string keys
- No deduplication based on actual reminder state
- No tracking of in-progress scheduling operations
- Processed reminders cleared every 60 seconds regardless of state

**Fix Applied** (`hooks/reminder-engine.tsx`):
```typescript
// Changed from Set<string> to Map<string, number> for hash-based deduplication
const processedReminders = useRef(new Map<string, number>());
const schedulingInProgress = useRef(new Set<string>());

// Calculate hash of reminder state
const reminderKey = `${reminder.id}-${reminder.date}-${reminder.time}-${reminder.snoozeUntil || ''}-${reminder.nextReminderDate || ''}`;
const currentHash = reminderKey.split('').reduce((acc, char) => acc + char.charCodeAt(0), 0);

// Skip if already processed with same hash
if (lastProcessedHash === currentHash && !schedulingInProgress.current.has(reminder.id)) {
  continue;
}

// Track scheduling in progress
schedulingInProgress.current.add(reminder.id);
notificationService.scheduleReminderByModel(reminder)
  .then(() => {
    processedReminders.current.set(reminder.id, currentHash);
    schedulingInProgress.current.delete(reminder.id);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    schedulingInProgress.current.delete(reminder.id);
  });
```

**Impact**: 
- Eliminates redundant notification scheduling
- Prevents race conditions
- Improves performance and battery life

---

### 4. ✅ FIXED: Full-Screen Intent Routing for Ringer Mode
**Issue**: When app was in killed state and phone locked, full-screen intent would sometimes open the main app screen instead of the alarm screen.

**Root Cause**:
- Notification data didn't include explicit route information
- Full-screen action didn't have proper routing metadata
- Initial notification handling logic had multiple competing conditions

**Fix Applied** (`hooks/notification-service.ts` & `app/_layout.tsx`):

**notification-service.ts**:
```typescript
// Added explicit route data
data: { 
  reminderId: reminder.id, 
  priority: reminder.priority,
  isFullScreenAlarm: isRinger ? 'true' : 'false',
  title: reminder.title,
  route: isRinger ? 'alarm' : 'index'  // NEW
}

// Enhanced full-screen action
if (isRinger) {
  notificationConfig.android.fullScreenAction = {
    id: 'alarm_fullscreen',
    launchActivity: 'default',
    mainComponent: 'alarm'  // NEW
  };
}
```

**_layout.tsx**:
```typescript
// Improved detection logic with fallback
if (isFullScreenAlarm === 'true' && (!initial.pressAction || initial.pressAction.id === 'alarm_fullscreen')) {
  console.log('[RootLayout] Full-screen alarm detected - app launched from locked screen');
  setAlarmLaunchOrigin('fullscreen');
  router.replace(`/alarm?reminderId=${reminderId}&title=${encodeURIComponent(title)}`);
  return;
}

// Added route-based fallback
if (route === 'alarm' && isRinger) {
  console.log('[RootLayout] Routing to alarm screen based on route data');
  setAlarmLaunchOrigin('fullscreen');
  router.replace(`/alarm?reminderId=${reminderId}&title=${encodeURIComponent(title)}`);
  return;
}
```

**Impact**: Full-screen alarms now consistently open the alarm screen, not the home screen.

### 5. ✅ FIXED: Notification Cancellation Order
**Issue**: In `rescheduleReminderById`, notification was being cancelled AFTER updating the reminder state, causing a brief window where old notification could fire.

**Root Cause**: Order of operations in snooze flow

**Fix Applied** (`services/reminder-scheduler.ts`):
```typescript
// Moved cancellation BEFORE state update
await notificationService.cancelAllNotificationsForReminder(reminderId);

reminder.snoozeUntil = new Date(nextTime).toISOString();
reminder.wasSnoozed = true;
reminder.lastTriggeredAt = new Date().toISOString();

await updateReminder(reminder);
```

**Impact**: Eliminates race condition where old notification could fire during snooze operation.

---

### 6. ✅ IMPROVED: Reminder Engine Cleanup Logic
**Issue**: Stale reminder IDs remained in processed map even after reminders were deleted.

**Fix Applied** (`hooks/reminder-engine.tsx`):
```typescript
const cleanupInterval = setInterval(() => {
  const staleKeys: string[] = [];
  processedReminders.current.forEach((_, key) => {
    if (!reminders.find(r => r.id === key)) {
      staleKeys.push(key);
    }
  });
  staleKeys.forEach(key => processedReminders.current.delete(key));
}, 60000);
```

**Impact**: Memory leak prevention and cleaner state management.

---

### 7. ✅ IMPROVED: Inactive Reminder Cleanup
**Issue**: Inactive, completed, or paused reminders remained in processed map.

**Fix Applied** (`hooks/reminder-engine.tsx`):
```typescript
for (const reminder of reminders) {
  if (!reminder.isActive || reminder.isCompleted || reminder.isPaused) {
    processedReminders.current.delete(reminder.id);  // NEW
    continue;
  }
  // ... rest of processing
}
```

**Impact**: Cleaner state management and prevents processing of inactive reminders.

## Architecture Review

### ✅ Background Handling
**Status**: CORRECT
- Headless task properly registered (`services/headless-task.js`)
- Boot receiver correctly triggers reschedule service
- Notification channels properly configured with `allowWhileIdle: true`

### ✅ Notification Hooks
**Status**: CORRECT
- Foreground event handler in `_layout.tsx` properly handles all event types
- Initial notification handling covers all launch scenarios
- Action press events correctly routed to scheduler functions

### ✅ Reminder Engine
**Status**: FIXED (see issues #3, #6, #7)
- Now properly deduplicates scheduling operations
- Correctly manages processed reminder state
- Cleans up stale entries

### ✅ Scheduler Functions
**Status**: FIXED (see issues #1, #2, #5)
- `rescheduleReminderById` now properly orders operations
- `markReminderDone` handles all reminder types correctly
- Snooze state properly managed

### ✅ Android System Integration
**Status**: CORRECT
- Manifest permissions properly configured
- Boot receiver and service correctly implemented
- Full-screen intent attributes set correctly

---

## Remaining Considerations

### 1. Notification Trigger Callback (Not Implemented)
**Current State**: System relies on user interaction (Done/Snooze buttons or notification tap) to update reminder state.

**Consideration**: There's no automatic background handler that fires when a notification triggers. This means:
- If user dismisses notification without interaction, reminder state doesn't update
- For repeating reminders, next occurrence isn't calculated until user interacts

**Recommendation**: This is acceptable for current design since:
- Notifications are persistent (`ongoing: true`, `autoCancel: false`)
- User must interact to dismiss
- Reminder engine will recalculate on next app open

### 2. Doze Mode Handling
**Current State**: Using `allowWhileIdle: true` in alarm manager trigger.

**Status**: CORRECT - This ensures notifications fire during Doze mode for all priority levels.

### 3. Exact Alarm Permission
**Current State**: Checking for `AndroidNotificationSetting.ENABLED` on `alarm` permission.

**Status**: CORRECT - Properly requests and checks exact alarm permission.
