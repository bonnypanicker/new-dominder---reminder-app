# Reminder System Fixes Applied

## Issues Identified and Fixed:

### 1. **AlarmActivity Not Connected to JS Layer**
**Problem**: AlarmActivity's snooze and dismiss buttons just called `dismissAlarm()` without actually updating reminder state.

**Fix**: 
- Added `handleSnooze()` and `handleDismiss()` methods that launch MainActivity with action intents
- These intents carry `action`, `reminderId`, and `snoozeMinutes` data
- MainActivity now handles these intents and emits events to React Native

### 2. **AlarmReceiver Always Launching Full-Screen**
**Problem**: AlarmReceiver always launched AlarmActivity regardless of screen state.

**Fix**:
- Added screen state detection using `KeyguardManager` and `PowerManager`
- When screen is locked/off: Launch full-screen AlarmActivity
- When screen is unlocked: Show persistent notification instead
- Persistent notification taps open AlarmActivity

### 3. **No Persistent Notification for Ringer Mode**
**Problem**: Ringer reminders had no notification when screen was unlocked.

**Fix**:
- Added `showPersistentNotification()` method in AlarmReceiver
- Creates ongoing notification with tap action to open AlarmActivity
- Uses separate "ringer-notifications" channel

### 4. **MainActivity Not Handling Alarm Actions**
**Problem**: No bridge between native AlarmActivity actions and JS reminder functions.

**Fix**:
- Added `handleAlarmIntent()` method in MainActivity
- Handles both `onCreate` and `onNewIntent` to catch all launches
- Emits `alarmAction` events to React Native with action data
- React Native listener calls `rescheduleReminderById()` or `markReminderDone()`

### 5. **Redundant Full-Screen Detection Logic**
**Problem**: app/_layout.tsx had complex, unreliable logic trying to detect full-screen alarms.

**Fix**:
- Removed unreliable `isFullScreenAlarm` detection logic
- Simplified to only handle standard/silent notification taps
- Ringer mode now handled entirely by native AlarmReceiver → AlarmActivity → MainActivity flow

## Flow After Fixes:

### Ringer Mode (High Priority):

#### Screen Locked:
1. AlarmModule schedules native alarm
2. AlarmReceiver detects screen is locked
3. Launches AlarmActivity (full-screen, wakes screen)
4. User taps Snooze/Done
5. AlarmActivity launches MainActivity with action intent
6. MainActivity emits `alarmAction` event
7. React Native calls `rescheduleReminderById()` or `markReminderDone()`
8. AlarmActivity finishes

#### Screen Unlocked:
1. AlarmModule schedules native alarm
2. AlarmReceiver detects screen is unlocked
3. Shows persistent notification
4. User taps notification body
5. Opens AlarmActivity
6. User taps Snooze/Done
7. Same flow as above (steps 5-8)

### Standard/Silent Mode:
1. Notifee schedules trigger notification
2. Notification appears at trigger time
3. User taps notification body → opens app home
4. User taps action buttons → handled by notifee foreground/background handlers

## Testing Checklist:
- [ ] Ringer reminder with screen locked → Full-screen alarm appears
- [ ] Ringer reminder with screen unlocked → Persistent notification appears
- [ ] Tap notification → Opens AlarmActivity
- [ ] Tap Snooze in AlarmActivity → Reminder snoozed, app closes
- [ ] Tap Done in AlarmActivity → Reminder marked done, app closes
- [ ] Standard reminder → Notification with action buttons
- [ ] Silent reminder → Silent notification with action buttons
- [ ] Action buttons work from notification
- [ ] Repeating reminders reschedule correctly
- [ ] One-time reminders complete correctly
